## About

Founder & CEO of **[Hack In The Box (HITB)](https://conference.hitb.org)** — the premier deep-knowledge security conference series running since 2003 and today VP of Global Strategy and Growth, at Verichains. I work at the intersection of **business strategy, AI, web3, and security**. When I'm not organizing conferences or working on Verichains stuff, I'm building tools at the intersection of **AI** and **offensive security** or dabbling with music production.
