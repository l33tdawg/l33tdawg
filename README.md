## About

Founder & CEO of **[Hack In The Box (HITB)](https://conference.hitb.org)** — the premier deep-knowledge security conference series running since 2003. What started as a small gathering of Malaysian security specialists has grown into a global platform with annual events in **Amsterdam**, **Bangkok**, **Jakarta**, and beyond.

When I'm not organizing conferences, I'm building tools at the intersection of **AI** and **offensive security**.
